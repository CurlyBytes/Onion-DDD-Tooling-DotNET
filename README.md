<h2>DDD - Onion Architecture Example with C#</h2>

Onion architecture is one of the best options to establish clean architecture through Domain-Driven-Design. <br>
This project intend to apply all best practices with Clean Code & Clean Architecture.<br>
This example project is always in progress :)<br><br>

<u>I´m testing some tools in project</u>:

<i>MediatR for Command Query Responsability Segregation</i><br>

<br>

<br>

<br><br>

<i>FluentValidation for separate entities validation - SoC</i><br>
https://github.com/JeremySkinner/FluentValidation
<br><br>
   
<i>MassTransit for Domain Events</i><br>

<br>

<br><br>

I followed the separate concept of Raise & Publish (dispatching only when persisted entity and raise when occurred in memory).<br>

If you think that some part of the code not follow some best practice feel free for fork and contribute!<br>
Thanks!
